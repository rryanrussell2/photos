# Photos App

### Getting Started

- Have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- Run `docker compose up --build -d`
- Go get a beverage while it pulls images and builds
- Once `postgres` is up, you'll probably have to run `docker restart photos-api`
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/

### TODO

- Remove unused boilerplate from CRA
- Cap upload file size
- Handle small images more nicely
- Display image names
- Allow image renaming
- Show full image in lightbox when selected
- Allow images to be deleted
